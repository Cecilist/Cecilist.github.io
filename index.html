									<h2><a href = https://github.com/Cecilist/ComicBookSearch-1>Comic Book Search</a></h2>
									<p> Created in collaboration
										with 3 other CS students for CS 222 Advanced Programming. The program is used to display a list
									Marvel comics associated with a character or creator.  </p>
								

								
									<h2><a href = https://github.com/Cecilist/twp-jdcecil-cjwillis-1>Wikipedia Recent Revisions</a></h2>

									<h2>Hash Table Implementation</h2>
								<p>With a partner, for CS 224 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, we set an implementaion of a Hash table with chaining in python.  </p>
								

									<h2>Parser</h2>
								<p>For CS380, Theory of Computation, I was tasked with setting up a simple parser in C++ to determine rather or not a given input is part of the accepted language provided by the professor.</p>
				
									<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
								<p>For TDPT 280 3D prototyping, I created several 3D models and printed those models on various types of 3D printers. Models include a cartoonish penguin, a dice tower, and a phone stand.</p>

						<h2>Work Experience</h2>
					</div><!--// .yui-u -->

					<div class="yui-u">
						<h2>Target</h2>
						<h2>Starbucks Team Member</h2>
						<h4>2014-</h4>
						<p>My most recenent job title makes this kind of confusing. I'm a Starbucks Team Member, meaning I work for Target, but I work at the Starbucks kiosk inside of Target. Previous roles
							I've held with company include electronics team member, cashier, service advocate (handling returns and whatever a customer may need at the guest service desk, inlcuding acting as the 
							phone operator), cash office, and cart attendent.

						<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					</div><!--// .yui-u -->

					<div class="yui-u">
						<p>I enjoy playing games. I've enjoyed several tabletop and video games over the years. Some that I've 
							enjoyed the most are Magic the Gathering, Super Smash Brothers, and Tekken. I consider myself to be
							passionate about technology, and try to keep up with any technolgy related to new and emerging tech.
							When it comes to computer science, my favorite thing tends to be problem solving. Some career fields that
							interest me are game design, database management, and security.
						</p>
						<p>Another hobby that I have would be dogs. My family has been breeding German Shorthaired Pointers for about 
							as long as I've been alive. Our family kennel name is HotwiredGSPs. My mom and sister are also into dog shows. 
							I've helped raise numerous litters of GSP puppies. I also help maintain the <a href ="https://teamhotwired.com/"> Hotwired website</a> (though its currently
							a bit outdated)</p>
							<p>I also enjoy cooking, though I tend to set off the smoke detectors every time I try and cook dinner.</p>

							<h2>Volunteering</h2>
						<p>While at Garden City High School, I particoated in several voluneteer events through AFJROTC, such as adopt a highway, school beutification projects, assiting in running a food pantry,
							and Salvation Army Bell ringing. Also while at GCHS, but outside of AFJROTC, I was a volunteer librarian's assistant at the high scool library.  </p>
