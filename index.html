									<h2><a href = https://github.com/mkidd04/RefReps-Education>RefReps Education</a></h2>
									<p> For my Capstone project at Ball State University, 3 other Computer Science senoirs and I parterned with RefReps to develop a learning 
										managment sytem geared towards high school students interested in training to become referees. This project uses the MEAN tech stack.
										That is, we used MongoDB, Express and Node. </p>

									<h2><a href = https://github.com/Cecilist/Final-BossFightBulletShooter>Star Cry</a></h2>
									<p> Made for CS315 Game Programming at Ball State. For my final project, I partnered with a classmate to make a 2D shooter game called Star Cry
										This project was created using the Godot game engine, utilizing GDScript. You can find Star Cry hosted on 
										<a href = https://cecilist.itch.io/starcry>itch.io</a> </p>

								
									<h2><a href = https://github.com/Cecilist/ComicBookSearch-1>Comic Book Search</a></h2>
									<p> Created in collaboration
										with 3 other CS students for CS 222 Advanced Programming. The program is used to display a list
									Marvel comics associated with a character or creator.  </p>
								
									<h2><a href = https://github.com/Cecilist/twp-jdcecil-cjwillis-1>Wikipedia Recent Revisions</a></h2>
									<p>For CS 222 Advnaced Programming Paired up with one other student, we created a program that lists the Wikipedia users that most recently
									edited a given article.</p>

									<h2>Parser</h2>
								<p>For CS380, Theory of Computation, I was tasked with setting up a simple parser in C++ to determine rather or not a given input is part of the accepted language provided by the professor.</p>
				
									<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
								<p>For TDPT 280 3D prototyping, I created several 3D models and printed those models on various types of 3D printers. Models include a cartoonish penguin, a dice tower, and a phone stand.</p>

					<div class="yui-u">
						<p>I enjoy playing games. I've enjoyed several tabletop and video games over the years. Some that I've 
							enjoyed the most are Magic the Gathering, Super Smash Brothers, and Tekken. I consider myself to be
							passionate about technology, and try to keep up with any technolgy related to new and emerging tech.
							When it comes to computer science, my favorite thing tends to be problem solving. Some career fields that
							interest me are data science, game development, and security.
						</p>
						<p>Another hobby that I have would be dogs. My family has been breeding German Shorthaired Pointers for about 
							as long as I've been alive. Our family kennel name is HotwiredGSPs. I've helped raise numerous litters of GSP puppies. 
							I also help maintain the <a href ="https://teamhotwired.com/"> Hotwired website</a> (though its currently a bit outdated)</p>
