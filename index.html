<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I enjoy playing games. I've enjoyed several tabletop and video games over the years. Some that I've
	enjoyed the most are Magic the Gathering, Super Smash Brothers, and Tekken. I consider myself to be
	passionate about technology, and try to keep up with any technolgy related to new and emerging tech.
	When it comes to computer science, my favorite thing tends to be problem solving. Some career fields that
	interest me are game design, database management, and security. </p>
	<p>Another hobby that I have would be dogs. My family has been breeding German Shorthaired Pointers for about 
		as long as I've been alive. Our family kennel name is HotwiredGSPs. My mom and sister are also into dog shows. 
		I've helped raise numerous litters of GSP puppies. I also help maintain the <a href ="https://teamhotwired.com/"> Hotwired website</a> (though its currently
		a bit outdated)
